Group project for my Intro to Web Applications class at UCSC. The tech stack that
we were given to use was JavaScript, React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL. This
project was given to us with the goal to clone the Facebook Marketplace as close
as possible given what we've learned in the quarter and resources that our professor
provided with us. We primarily relied on Material UI components to create our UI,
with alot of time spent figuring out the communiation between the frontend and backend
as well as unit testing as no one in the group have done this type of programming and
testing before.
