A group project from my Intro to Software Engineering course at UCSC. The tech stack 
we used included JavaScript, React, Node, MySQL, and a Netflix API. This was my first
time developing while following Scrum/Agile, which added the feeling of working in the
workforce with those kind of development periods. The website is an online forum where
users can search and post discussions about any Netflix shows found on the Netflix 
platform.
